# ride-share-price-prediction

In this project, our primary objective is to provide a prediction of Uber and Lyft surge prices under different weather and geolocation factors, such as: temperature, rain, wind, pick up location, and destination, to enhance passengersâ€™ ability to make informed booking decisions.
We aim to solve the problem of fluctuating Uber and Lyft fares under the influence of unpredictable surge pricing, offering passengers a reliable tool to estimate the cost of their trips.
Our analysis is geared towards examining the Uber and Lyft trips in Boston during 11/26/2018 to.12/18/2018. By finding the most related factors that affect fare prices, we will first use Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and XGBoost Regression models to find the most accurate model for prediction. Then, we will use feature importance to pinpoint the most important factors that influence price for Uber and Lyft separately.

Accessing Kaggle's data, cab_rides, and weather datasets provides a valuable opportunity to delve into the dynamics of Uber and Lyft taxi prices during the week of November-December 2018. The cab_rides data set consists of 10 columns and 693,070 rows and provides a comprehensive view of the various types of taxis offered by Uber and Lyft, including pricing and location information.
The weather dataset has 8 columns and 6,275 rows and provides information about weather attributes for various locations and books. This includes temperature, precipitation (rain) and cloud cover information. Integrating weather data into the analysis can provide a better understanding of how external factors such as weather conditions affect Uber and Lyft prices.
